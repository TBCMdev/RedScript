                <h2 id="title">What is RedScript?</h2>
                <p>RedScript is a programming language that converts high level code into minecraft commands that can be executed
                    at any time. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    It significantly speeds up the development process of projects such as minigames or maps, all in vanilla minecraft.

                    It is packed full of features, and <a href="/docs">documented in detail</a> for people learning the language.
                    <br><br>
                    To accomplish this in minecraft is no easy challenge, and comes with performance drawbacks if the language is not used
                    correctly. That is why we recommend you read the <a href="/docs/getting_started">getting started</a> page to understand
                    the potential drawbacks that RedScript has. 
                    <br><br>
                    RedScript is currently in beta, and isn't recommended to employ in any large scale projects as of yet. We encourage you 
                    to try it for fun and to give feedback.
                    <br><br>
                    If you or someone you know is knowledgable in Minecraft commands or programming, then <a href="/contact">helping to test</a>
                    RedScript and give suggestions would be a great help!

                    Hello! I'm TBCM, the one and only developer of RedScript. I'm a college student who has been programming
                    for around 8 years.
                    <br><br>
                    My goto language is C++, but I have experience in almost all mainstream languages.
                    <br><br>
                    Making a programming language isn't easy, and I'm positive there are lots of gaps and problems
                    in RedScript's source code at the moment. Because of this, I'd really appreciate it if you could try it out
                    and give me some constructive feedback!
                    <br><br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="contribute">
                <h2 id="title">Want to Help?</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                If you feel like you would like to test RedScript, then just head to <a href="/downloads"> the downloads page</a> and try it out!
                <br><br>
                If you would like a new feature added or a bug fixed, you can visit the <a href="/community">community</a> tab to file a request. 
                <br><br>
                Redscript does take a lot of time and effort, so if you would like to make commits to the official repo and be apart of the team,
                please <a href="/contact">contact me directly</a>.
                <br><br>
                And lastly, you can <a href="/donate">donate</a> some money if you enjoy this software, but as always its not mandatory!
