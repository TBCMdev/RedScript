# RedScript
Redscript is a c++ written compiler that converts high level code into minecraft commands inside mc functions.
Essentially, programs can be run in minecraft using `RedScript` to produce Minecraft redstone/command projects with ease.


Despite what is said below, this project is in early beta, and the project + website are still in development.

# Getting Started
First you will need to install the latest version from our website ([mcredscript.com](https://mcredscript.com)) if it is running, or rather from the github version control. 
**It is important to note that** RedScript employs the use of [function macros]() as well as the newly implemented commands associated with functions such as `return`. Any version used before these commands were introduced will lead to nearly all commands failing. Make sure your version is above 1.20.

**To get started learning the language, visit [our website](https://mcredscript.com).**

# Bugs

As with all programming projects, errors and bugs are everywhere. To submit a bug report, please visit [our website](https://mcredscript.com).

# Other Versions

To use another version, you can download them from the version control here on github.
